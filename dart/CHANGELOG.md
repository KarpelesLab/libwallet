## 0.3.3

- **Bitcoin balance fix**: `modchain_assets` returns `balance` as a
  decimal-formatted number (`"0.00000000"`), not int64. Decode via
  `outscript.BtcAmount` which handles both forms. Previously failed with:
  `json: cannot unmarshal number 0.00000000 into Go struct field`.
- **Solana NFT fix**: `getAssetsByOwner` (Helius DAS API) requires named
  JSON-RPC params, not positional. New `Network.DoRPCNamed()` helper.
  Previously failed with: `invalid type: map, expected a string`.
- **Bitcoin UTXO decode**: `modchain_lookupTxoBIP32` response uses the
  same `BtcAmount` serialization for `amt` and `balance` fields. Type
  switched from int64 to outscript.BtcAmount across wlttx/bitcoin.go.
- **EVM NFT lookup hardening**: type assertions on the `modchain_assets`
  response in wltnet/nft.go could panic if any field was missing or the
  wrong type. Replaced with comma-ok form.
- iOS Dart Tests CI timeout bumped 45 → 60 minutes (Xcode build slow).

## 0.3.2

- **iOS simulator support**: build hook now detects `iphoneos` vs
  `iphonesimulator` SDK and downloads the correct binary. Previously
  the simulator would try to link the device-only binary and fail.
- Release now includes `liblibwallet-iossimulator-arm64.a` (Apple Silicon)
  and `liblibwallet-iossimulator-x64.a` (Intel Mac simulators) alongside
  the existing `liblibwallet-ios-arm64.a` device binary.

## 0.3.1

- **Bitcoin HD address support**: `bitcoin`-type accounts now derive
  multi-address HD trees under their account xpub. Balance queries call
  `modchain_assets(xpub)` which scans `0..lastI+20` child keys (BIP-44
  style gap limit) server-side.
- New `AccountApi.xpub(id)`: returns the BIP-32 extended public key.
- New `AccountApi.nextAddress(id)`: returns the next clean receive (or
  change) address based on on-chain scan.
- New `AccountApi.allAddresses(id)`: lists all HD addresses across
  receive and change chains with activity markers.
- `Account.Address` now points to `m/0/0` (first receive address) instead
  of `m/0` for Bitcoin-family accounts. BTC/LTC/DOGE/BCH supported.

## 0.3.0

- **EIP-1559 transactions**: Auto-selected when the chain supports it. New
  `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` fields on `Transaction`.
- **ERC-20 transfers**: New `erc20_transfer` transaction type. Pass a token
  XUID in `Asset`, recipient in `To`, and amount — libwallet encodes the
  `transfer(address,uint256)` call automatically.
- **ENS / SNS name resolution**: New `client.names.resolve('vitalik.eth')` API.
  Auto-detects `.eth` (Ethereum) and `.sol` (Solana) suffixes.
- **Solana devnet**: Routes to the correct Helius devnet RPC endpoint
  when using a Solana network with `chainId: "devnet"`.
- Local dev: `hook/build.dart` now prefers a local `testserver/liblibwallet.<ext>`
  over downloading from GitHub Releases.
- Fix: macOS dylibs built with `-headerpad_max_install_names` so Dart can
  bundle them without relinking.

## 0.2.0

- Auto-download native binaries from GitHub Releases at build time
- CI testing on macOS, Android emulator, and iOS simulator
- 43 integration tests covering all API endpoints
- Full dartdoc on all model fields (~130 fields)
- Comprehensive README with usage examples

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
- FFI transport with `NativeCallable.listener` for Go→Dart callbacks
- 17 typed API classes covering all libwallet endpoints
- 15 model classes with full dartdoc
- Socket transport as legacy fallback
- Native asset hook for pub.dev binary distribution
